Overview
The Mobile Approval System is a comprehensive mobile application designed to streamline and automate the approval processes within an organization. This application allows employees to submit leave requests, and managers to review and approve these requests. Additionally, the system facilitates handling of financial transactions, such as expense approvals and budget allocations, ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow.
